This is a MATLAB script for exporting modal shapes from ANSYS to MATLAB.

**To use it:**

1. Copy and paste the script into a new MATLAB file and save it with a .m extension.
2. Open ANSYS and load the modal analysis results that you want to export.
3. In MATLAB, run the script.

**The script will:**

1. Prompt you to enter the following information:
    * The path where you want to save the exported data.
    * The name of the exported file.
    * The name of the named selection containing the nodes that you want to export.
2. Export the modal shapes to a text file in the specified location.
3. Export additional information about the nodes and modes to a separate text file.

**The exported data can then be used in MATLAB for further analysis or visualization.**

**Here is a breakdown of the script:**

**Lines 1-3:** Define the file format and encoding.

**Lines 5-7:** Define the variables that will be used in the script.

**Lines 9-13:** Get the number of nodes and modes from ANSYS.

**Lines 15-17:** Prompt the user to enter the path and name of the exported files.

**Lines 19-21:** Get the name of the named selection containing the nodes that the user wants to export.

**Lines 23-25:** Select the nodes in the named selection.

**Lines 27-32:** Create a matrix to store the modal shapes.

**Lines 34-44:** Loop over the modes and nodes:
    * Get the nodal coordinates and modal amplitudes from ANSYS.
    * Write the nodal coordinates and modal amplitudes to the matrix.

**Lines 46-48:** Write the modal shape matrix to a text file.

**Lines 50-54:** Create an array to store information about the nodes and modes.

**Lines 56-58:** Write the information array to a text file.

**Lines 60-62:** Close the ANSYS database.

**Lines 64-67:** Prompt the user to open the exported files in MATLAB.

**Note:** The script is currently configured to export modal shapes for frequencies up to 2000Hz. To export modal shapes for higher frequencies, change the value of `F5` in the line `(F5.0,E16.8)`.
